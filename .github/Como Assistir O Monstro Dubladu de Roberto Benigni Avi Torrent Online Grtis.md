The film was directed by Roberto Benigni, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Vincenzo Cerami and Michel Blanc. It was a co-production between Italy and France, and it was released in Italy on 22 October 1994 and in the U.S. on 19 April 1996. The film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, and it won the David di Donatello Award for Best Film in 1995. The film was also a huge commercial success, grossing $24.8 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film in Italy at the time, until it was surpassed by Benigni's next film, Life is Beautiful, in 1997.
 
The film is a parody of the thriller genre, mocking the stereotypes and clichÃ©s of serial killers and police investigations. The film also showcases Benigni's trademark physical comedy and slapstick humor, as he performs various absurd and hilarious situations while being pursued by the police. The film also features a romantic subplot between Loris and Jessica, who gradually fall in love despite their different personalities and roles. The film is considered one of Benigni's best works, and one of the funniest Italian comedies of all time.

Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include: Loris' failed attempt to seduce a woman at a party, who turns out to be a nun; Loris' encounter with a Chinese teacher, who gives him a good luck charm that later incriminates him; Loris' visit to a tailor, who is actually a police doctor who performs various tests on him; Loris' interview at a Chinese company, where he fails to say his name in Chinese; and Loris' final confrontation with the real killer, who is revealed to be his Chinese teacher.
 
The film also features a talented supporting cast, including Nicoletta Braschi as Jessica, Benigni's real-life wife and frequent collaborator; Michel Blanc as Paride, the police doctor who is obsessed with catching Loris; Dominique Lavanant as Jolanda, Paride's eccentric assistant; Jean-Claude Brialy as Roccarotta, the chief of police who is frustrated by Loris' innocence; and Massimo Girotti as the distinguished resident who witnesses Loris' antics.

The film was inspired by Benigni's own experience of being mistaken for a terrorist at an airport. He decided to make a comedy out of this situation, and he co-wrote the script with his longtime partner Vincenzo Cerami and French actor Michel Blanc. The film was shot in Rome and Paris, and it featured a soundtrack composed by Evan Lurie. The film was well received by critics and audiences alike, who praised Benigni's performance and direction, as well as the film's satire and humor. The film was also nominated for several awards, including the European Film Award for Best Actor for Benigni.
