The latest patch for EVERSPACE, version 1.3.5, was released on October 2, 2019, coinciding with the launch of the Kickstarter campaign for EVERSPACE 2, the sequel to the original game. The patch features a number of tweaks and bugfixes that improve the gameplay experience and performance of EVERSPACE. Here are some of the highlights of the patch:
  
- Show energy allocation of passive devices in ship stats screen: This feature allows players to see how much energy is consumed by their passive devices, such as shields, sensors, or scanners. This can help players optimize their energy management and plan their upgrades accordingly.
- VR: tweaked the display of some HUD markers: This tweak improves the visibility and readability of some HUD elements in VR mode, such as waypoints, objectives, or enemy indicators. This can enhance the immersion and navigation of VR players.
- Linux: Added missing option to change the size of the HUD markers: This option gives Linux players more control over the size of the HUD markers, which can affect their preference and comfort level.
- Added button in main menu advertising the Kickstarter campaign for EVERSPACE 2: This button directs players to the Kickstarter page for EVERSPACE 2, where they can learn more about the sequel and support its development. The button will automatically remove itself on January 8th, 2020.
- Fixed using Drone Disassembler on own drones not decreasing current drone count: This bugfix prevents players from exploiting the Drone Disassembler device, which allows them to salvage resources from destroyed drones. Previously, using this device on their own drones did not reduce their drone count, allowing them to deploy more drones than intended.
- Fixed splitter glyph additional projectiles having incorrect range/lifetime: This bugfix corrects the behavior of the splitter glyph weapon mod, which splits projectiles into multiple smaller ones. Previously, the additional projectiles had a shorter range and lifetime than intended, reducing their effectiveness.
- Fixed life support damage sound still playing during game credits when winning a run with damaged life support system: This bugfix removes an annoying sound effect that persisted during the game credits after completing a run with a damaged life support system.
- VR: Fixed that the scatter gun didn't have additional projectiles on max. charge: This bugfix restores the intended functionality of the scatter gun weapon in VR mode, which should fire additional projectiles when fully charged.
- VR: fixed that combat drones were lost to the player after a jump: This bugfix prevents VR players from losing their combat drones after jumping to a new sector.
- Fixed a bug where ore from mining drills would fly away out of reach right after being spawned when having tractor beam installed and being within pull range: This bugfix ensures that ore from mining drills can be collected by players who have a tractor beam device installed on their ship.

The patch 1.3.5 for EVERSPACE is available now for Windows, Mac, Linux, and VR platforms. Players can download it through Steam or GOG Galaxy. The patch notes are also available on Steam News[^1^] and Steam Community[^2^].
