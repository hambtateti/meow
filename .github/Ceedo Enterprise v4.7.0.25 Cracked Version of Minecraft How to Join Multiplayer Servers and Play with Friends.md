Voxengo Elephant Full has several features that make it stand out from other limiter plugins. First of all, it has a variety of limiter modes that can be deeply customized to suit different genres and styles. You can choose from different types of limiting algorithms, such as EL-4, EL-5, EL-C, EL-M, EL-S, EL-A, and EL-INFL. Each mode has its own character and behavior, and you can tweak various parameters such as attack, release, knee, shape, dithering, oversampling, and more.
 
Another feature of Voxengo Elephant Full is its sonic transparency. Unlike some limiters that introduce audible artifacts such as fuzz and pumping, Voxengo Elephant Full preserves the natural dynamics and timbre of your audio material. It does this by using a linear-phase oversampling technique that prevents inter-sample overshoots (true-peak limiting). This way, you can achieve high-quality peak limiting and loudness maximization without compromising the sound quality.
 
Voxengo Elephant Full also comes with a comprehensive set of level metering tools that help you monitor and adjust the loudness of your audio. You can use the headroom estimation tool to find the optimal input level for your limiter. You can also use the EBU R128 and K-system metering tools to measure the loudness level of your audio according to different standards. Additionally, you can use the waveform graph to visualize the limiting process in real-time.
 
Voxengo Elephant Full is a highly competitive plugin for mastering applications. It can be used for mastering of both stereo and multi-channel audio material, at any standard sample rate. It can also be used for mixing purposes, such as stem, sub-mix, or drum bus compression. Moreover, it has some extra features such as a bit-depth converter with noise-shaping, a DC offset removal filter, and a color scheme editor.
 
If you want to try Voxengo Elephant Full for yourself, you can download a free trial version from the Voxengo website. The trial version has some limitations, such as occasional silence processing and a nag screen. To unlock the full functionality of the plugin, you need to purchase a license for $95.00 USD.
